# Numpy_basic_operation_on_loan_prediction_dataset
The aim is to master the essential techniques for opening, reading, writing, and closing files within Python, ensuring effective data access and resource management in software development or data analysis tasks.

Instructions

This ➡️ dataset contains loan information, including loan ID, customer gender, location, region, total price for each loan etc.

Begin by importing the necessary libraries, numpy.
Use the open() function to open csv file and assign the result to a variable.
Use the numpy array to perform some basic statistical analysis on the data, such as finding the mean, median, and standard deviation of the loan amounts.
Note:

Be sure to close the file after you have finished reading it in with the open() function.
Use the delimiter parameter in the genfromtxt() function to specify that commas separate the values in the file.
The NumPy functions mean(), median(), and std() allow you to find the mean, median, and standard deviation of the loan amounts.
